# JS Debugging and More CSS Layout

## Overview

Learning how to **debug** your code will help you to better identify the errors you see in your console, and how to fix them.

## Class Outline

- Code demo
  - Debugging workflow
- Lab preview and prep

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

Understand error codes like:

* SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input
* ReferenceError: x is not defined
* TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined 

TypeError example

    let seattle = new Store();
    let x = sattle.maxCust;
    // ERROR MESSAGE:
    // TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'sattleâ€™)

ReferenceError example

    let aveCookies = 2.3;
    let total = cust * avecookies;
    // ERROR MESSAGE:
    // ReferenceError: avecookies is not defined

SyntaxError example 

    let day = "Friday";
    let s = `Today is ${day !!!`;
    // ERROR MESSAGE:
    // SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input

## Notes

1. What are a few ways we can debug our code?

1. What are some of the error types you may encounter in the console?

### Major Browsers' Debugging Tools

**Keyboard**:

1. Windows: `ctrl` + `shift` + `i`

1. macOS: `command` + `option` + `i`

**Chrome**:

1. Open the browser.

1. From the menu, select "More Tools".

1. From tools, choose "Developer Tools".

1. Select Console.

**Firefox**:

1. Open the browser.

1. From the menu, select "Web Developer".

1. Select "Web Console".

**Safari**:

1. Go to Safari, Preferences, Advanced in the main menu.

1. Check "Enable Show Develop menu in menu bar".

1. From the Develop menu, select "Show Web Inspector".

## Video about breakpoints

You can debug with breakpoints in the browser. Breakpoints let you stop the code at a certain point, and examine what is going on.

## Array methods

You can do a lot of things with loops and arrays. But arrays also have methods you can use, too.
